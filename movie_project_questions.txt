Vote Average per release year and budget per release year follow a similar pattern, in both line charts vote average and budget slowly increase until about 1990. Then we see a sharp increase in both values based on the year, with a drop-off around 2010. 
Meanwhile, Profit and Adjusted Profit (profit based on Adjusted Budget and Adjusted Revenue) also show a more rapid change around 1990, but not as much as Budget or Vote Average. Both line charts for profit have a more steady incline and no drop-off at 2010. So, profits continue to rise beyond 2010. 
Based on several scatter plots, there does not seem to be a relationship between Vote Average and the following values: Budget, Adjusted Budget, Runtime, nor Release Year.
Average Budget: 3.720370e+07
Average Adjusted Budget: 4.423999e+07
Average Revenue: 1.076866e+08
Average Adjusted Revenue: 1.370647e+08

Scatter plots show a positive correlation with Revenue and Budget, but not with Revenue and Runtime, or Revenue and Release Year.
Most common movies and their total profit:
Action: 1.086483e+11
Adventure: 1.111163e+11
Comedy: 8.722095e+10
Drama: 8.125869e+10
Average profit of the most common genres: 9.706108e+10
